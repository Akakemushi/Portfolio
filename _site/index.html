  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>I specialize in building clean, reliable, user-focused web applications and providing custom solutions that help
    clients elevate their online presence. Whether you need a fully functional web app, a Shopify customization,
    performance improvements, or strategic problem-solving for an existing system, I can help bring your ideas to life.
    I enjoy working closely with clients to understand their goals, identify the best approach, and deliver flexible,
    maintainable solutions tailored to their needs. From backend logic and data structures to UI improvements and overall
    system design, I’m committed to producing work that feels smooth, intuitive, and genuinely helpful.
  </p>

<div class="intro-paragraph__block">
  <h2>Why I Do It</h2>
  <p>Although my professional career began in English education, I’ve been coding in some form since high school.
    Over the past five years, I’ve dedicated a significant portion of my time to web development, building real
    applications using Ruby on Rails, Django, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Shopify Liquid, and more.
    I love programming because it perfectly combines creativity with logical problem-solving; the kind of work where I
    can lose track of time while building something useful. Developing a study app for my students was the moment it
    clicked for me: this is the field where I feel energized, challenged, and genuinely excited to grow. Every new project
    is an opportunity to learn something, refine my skills, and create solutions that make someone’s life easier.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="intro-paragraph__block">
  <h2>Japan</h2>
  <p>I have lived and worked in Japan since 2006, beginning with the JET Program and later transitioning to roles in
    both public and private education before becoming a university lecturer. I hold an M.A. in TESOL, have co-authored
    textbooks, published academic research, and designed curriculum at the university level; all of which has shaped me
    into a clear communicator who understands how to break down complex ideas and collaborate effectively. I am fluent
    in professional Japanese communication, hold a Japanese driver’s license, and have extensive experience working in
    Japanese teams and organizations. These experiences, combined with my technical skills, allow me to bridge cultural
    and linguistic gaps and work comfortably with clients in Japan as well as abroad.

      <p class="details">This was the final project of my team while I was studying web development at Le Wagon, Tokyo.  My role was mostly back-end development, using Ruby on Rails, Redis, Sidekiq, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, and OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT and Dall-E-3 APIs. On front-end, I designed and implemented the story-creation interface and the loading page animation. One of my biggest achievements for this project was being able to substantially cut API-call wait times between story pages by using background jobs to generate subsequent story text and images. Thanks so much to my team members Alex Voler, who came up with the app idea, and Glenn Torrens for their hard work on this project.</p>
